#Midterm
This midterm allows mobile and desktop users to add fire hydrants they see to a map. Since students will be walking, this midterm is geared more towards mobile users.
Since some students may be doing a geography online major, I created another project as well.
Simply click "Add Hydrant" in the top right, click the "Find my Location" button, and then log the fire hydrant in Survey123!
This lab is a synthesis of past work, especially the mobile development lab, but with some additional aesthetics like a splash screen.
Thank you for viewing!
